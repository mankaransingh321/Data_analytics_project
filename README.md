📊 Python Data Analysis Project
🔍 Project Overview
This project dives deep into fitness and activity data, leveraging Python for insightful analysis and advanced visualizations. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations to better understand user behavior and highlight actionable insights for improving fitness.

By utilizing diverse datasets, we’ve analyzed activity levels, calorie burn patterns, and step distributions, offering a data-driven approach to enhancing physical activity routines.

📂 Datasets
percentage.csv: Contains percentage distributions of activity levels (very active, fairly active, lightly active, sedentary).
percentage2.csv: Provides time spent (in minutes) in different activity levels.
percentage3.csv: Adds cumulative statistics and positional values for activity levels.
week_calories_df.csv: Tracks calories burned across days of the week.
week_steps_df.csv: Logs total steps taken for each day of the week.
✨ Key Features
Comprehensive Analysis: Cleaned, merged, and analyzed datasets to ensure accuracy and relevance.
Diverse Visualizations:
Pie charts, line plots, and bar graphs for easy data interpretation.
Advanced visualizations like ridge plots, sunburst charts, 3D scatter plots, and parallel coordinate plots for deeper insights.
Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.
Actionable Insights:
Highlighted sedentary behavior dominance and areas for potential improvement.
Established correlations between steps taken and calories burned.
Identified activity trends across days of the week.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, joypy
Advanced Techniques: 3D plotting (mpl_toolkits.mplot3d), interactive visuals with plotly
Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis.
