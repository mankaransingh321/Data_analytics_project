Python Data Analysis Project

Overview
This project is a comprehensive exploration and analysis of fitness and activity data using Python. The primary objective is to understand trends, relationships, and distributions within the data, leveraging advanced visualization techniques and statistical insights.

The project incorporates multiple datasets to analyze activity levels, calories burned, and steps taken. Various visualizations and analytical methods have been applied to uncover patterns and provide actionable insights.

Datasets Used
The following datasets were utilized in this project:

percentage.csv: Contains percentage distribution of activity levels (e.g., very active, fairly active, lightly active, sedentary).
percentage2.csv: Provides activity levels with corresponding time in minutes.
percentage3.csv: Contains cumulative statistics for activity levels.
week_calories_df.csv: Tracks calories burned by day of the week.
week_steps_df.csv: Tracks total steps by day of the week.
Key Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing data, normalized metrics, and merged relevant datasets.
Visualizations:
Pie charts for activity proportions.
Line plots for trends in calories burned and steps taken.
Violin plots for variability in steps distribution.
Correlation heatmaps for relationships between key metrics.
Advanced visualizations such as ridge plots, pair plots, sunburst charts, and 3D scatter plots.
Insights & Recommendations:
Identified sedentary behavior as a significant portion of user activity, highlighting areas for improvement.
Demonstrated strong correlations between steps taken and calories burned.
Uncovered patterns and variability in activity by day of the week.
Technologies Used
Python Libraries:
Data Analysis: pandas, numpy
Visualizations: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, joypy
Advanced Techniques: 3D plotting with mpl_toolkits.mplot3d
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and analysis.
